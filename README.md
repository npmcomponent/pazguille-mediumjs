# Medium JS

A small library that implements the Mediator Pattern in JavaScript. The essence of the Mediator Pattern is to Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently".

## Installation

    $ component install pazguille/mediumjs

See: [https://github.com/component/component](https://github.com/component/component)

### Standalone
Also, you can use the standalone version without components.
```html
<script src="../standalone/medium.js"></script>
```

## How-to

First, requires the mediator instance:
```js
var medium = require('medium');
```

Now, defines a listener and subcribes to a channel:
```js
function informal(arg1, arg2) {
    alert(arg1);
    alert(arg2);
});

medium.subscribe('greet', informal);
```

Then, broadcasts a channel with some data:
```js
medium.publish('greet', 'Hi pazguille!', 'Bye pazguille!');
```

## API

### Medium#subscribe(channel, listener)
Adds a listener to given `channel`.
- `channel` - The name of the channel you want to subscribe.
- `listener` - Listener you want to execute to given channel.

```js
medium.subscribe('greet', informal);
```

### Medium#publish(channel, [arg1], [arg2], [...])
Execute each item in the listener collection in order with given data.
- `channel` - The name of the channel you want to subscribe.

```js
medium.publish('greet', 'Hi pazguille!', 'Bye pazguille!');
```

### Medium#remove(channel, listener)
Removes one or all listeners from the collection with given channel.
- `channel` - The name of the channel you want to remove.
- `listener` (optional) - Listener you want to remove from given channel.

```js
// removes a specific listener from the given channel
medium.remove('greet', informal);

// removes all listeners and the channel
medium.remove('greet');
```
